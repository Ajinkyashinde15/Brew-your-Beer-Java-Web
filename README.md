# Brew-your-Beer-Java-Web
The purpose of this project was to develop an online web application that creates craft beer and handles orders. 

My aim for this project was to build a responsive website that will allow a user to sign up to our website then login and browse through the collections of readymade craft beers or create their own personalised drink from the taste right down to the bottle logo or text.  
The site should be easily navigated and run completely without any errors. There should be security steps in place to ensure our users are of age. Once you create your profile you should be able to edit details after.

The technologies that were used in my final build of this project were: 
•	JAVA 
•	HTML 
•	JavaScript
•	CSS 
•	MySQL 
•	Strut framework 

Functional requirements

The customer will need a way to choose what ingredients they would like, a log in to check the status of their order, a checkout, a database, a review page, and be responsive on any platforms. The software requirements would be HTML, CSS, JAVA, MySQL, and JavaScript. 
We want the user to be able to:
•	Sign up/Log in  
•	Create product
•	Beer customization 
•	Add to cart
•	Order product
•	Checkout + purchasing
•	Review products 

GUI
This section displays the wireframes of various pages of my application. It displays what I intend the interface will look like. It is a rough idea and there is still more to add.
